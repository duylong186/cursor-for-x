# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Web UI with Chat Interface and Interactive Information Display

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This PRD outlines the requirements for a web-based user interface built using Next.js and shadcn/ui, featuring a chat interface on the right and an interactive general information display on the left. The application aims to provide users with an intuitive, responsive, and engaging experience for real-time communication and dynamic information exploration.

### 1.2 Scope
The web UI will include:
- A responsive layout with a split-screen design (chat on the right, information display on the left).
- A chat interface for sending and receiving messages in real-time.
- An interactive information display for presenting dynamic content (e.g., data visualizations, summaries, or media).
- Integration with Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- Styling and components using shadcn/ui for a modern, accessible design.
- Basic state management for handling user interactions and data updates.

This PRD focuses on the frontend implementation, assuming a backend API exists for chat and information data.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- End users seeking an intuitive platform for communication and information exploration.
- Developers requiring a scalable frontend template for similar applications.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Layout and Structure
- **Split-Screen Design**:
  - The UI is divided into two main sections:
    - **Left Panel (60% width)**: Displays interactive general information.
    - **Right Panel (40% width)**: Hosts the chat interface.
  - Responsive design:
    - On desktop, panels are side-by-side.
    - On mobile (below 768px), panels stack vertically (information above chat).
- **Header**:
  - A fixed header with the app name and basic navigation (e.g., toggle theme, user profile).
- **Footer** (optional):
  - Displays version info or links to terms/privacy policies.

### 2.2 Chat Interface (Right Panel)
- **Message Display**:
  - Scrollable list of messages with sender names, timestamps, and message content.
  - Messages align left for others, right for the user.
- **Message Input**:
  - Text input field with a "Send" button.
  - Supports basic formatting (e.g., line breaks, emojis).
  - Input clears after sending.
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Messages update in real-time (assumes WebSocket or polling API).
- **Features**:
  - Typing indicators for other users.
  - Read receipts (optional, based on backend support).
  - Error handling for failed messages (e.g., network issues).
- **Accessibility**:
  - ARIA labels for screen readers.
  - Keyboard navigation for sending messages.

### 2.3 Interactive Information Display (Left Panel)
- **Content Types**:
  - Supports text, images, charts, and clickable elements (e.g., buttons, links).
  - Example: A dashboard with a summary, a bar chart, and a clickable list of items.
- **Interactivity**:
  - Users can click buttons or links to update content (e.g., filter data, switch views).
  - Animations for transitions (e.g., fade-in for new content).
- **Dynamic Updates**:
  - Content updates based on user actions or external data (e.g., API calls).
  - Example: Selecting a chat updates the left panel with related info.
- **Customization**:
  - Modular components for different content types (e.g., cards, tables).
  - Configurable via props or API data.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Alt text for images.
  - Keyboard-navigable controls.

### 2.4 Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: Next.js (latest stable version) for SSR, SSG, and API routes.
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui for components (e.g., buttons, inputs, cards).
- **State Management**:
  - React Context or Zustand for local state (e.g., chat messages, panel data).
  - No Redux unless complexity increases.
- **Styling**:
  - Tailwind CSS (included with shadcn/ui) for responsive, utility-first styling.
  - Theme support (light/dark mode) via shadcn/ui.
- **Performance**:
  - Lazy-load images and components in the information panel.
  - Optimize re-renders using React.memo and useCallback.
- **API Integration**:
  - Mock API endpoints for:
    - Fetching/sending chat messages.
    - Retrieving/updating information display data.
  - Error handling for API failures.
- **Browser Support**:
  - Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
  - Progressive enhancement for older browsers.

### 2.5 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**:
  - Initial page load < 2 seconds (desktop, 4G network).
  - Chat message rendering < 100ms.
- **Accessibility**:
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
  - Screen reader support for all interactive elements.
- **Security**:
  - Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS.
  - Secure API calls (assumes backend handles authentication).
- **Scalability**:
  - Modular code structure for adding new features (e.g., file uploads in chat).
  - Component reusability across panels.

## 3. User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want a responsive chat interface so I can send and receive messages seamlessly on any device.
2. **As a user**, I want an interactive information display so I can explore dynamic content like charts or summaries.
3. **As a user**, I want real-time updates in the chat so I can communicate without refreshing the page.
4. **As a user**, I want a clean, modern UI so I can focus on the content without distractions.
5. **As a developer**, I want a well-structured codebase so I can extend features like new content types or chat functionalities.

## 4. Design Considerations
- **UI Mockup**:
  - Use shadcn/ui components for consistency (e.g., Card, Input, Button).
  - Minimalist design with clear typography (e.g., Inter font).
  - Color scheme: Neutral base (white/gray) with accent colors (e.g., blue for buttons).
- **Responsive Breakpoints**:
  - Desktop: 1280px and above.
  - Tablet: 768pxâ€“1279px.
  - Mobile: Below 768px.
- **Animations**:
  - Subtle transitions for message arrivals and content updates (e.g., 0.3s ease-in).
  - Avoid excessive motion for accessibility.

## 5. Assumptions and Constraints
- **Assumptions**:
  - A backend API provides chat and information data.
  - Users are authenticated (handled by backend).
  - WebSocket or long-polling is available for real-time chat.
- **Constraints**:
  - No backend development in scope.
  - Limited to shadcn/ui components for UI consistency.
  - Initial release focuses on core features (chat and basic info display).

## 6. Milestones and Timeline

- **Risk**: Responsive design breaks on niche devices.
  - **Mitigation**: Test on multiple screen sizes using BrowserStack.
- **Risk**: Accessibility oversights.
  - **Mitigation**: Run axe-core audits during development.

## 9. Future Enhancements
- Add file uploads to chat (e.g., images, PDFs).
- Support advanced visualizations (e.g., 3D charts) in the information panel.
- Integrate user authentication and profiles.
- Add offline support via service workers.
